# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used

- GitHub Copilot (AI assistant in VS Code)
- Visual Studio Code
- Web browser for testing

## How AI Helped

AI was used throughout the project to assist with code generation, bug fixing, and feature suggestions. The assistant provided help with:

- Writing and improving JavaScript for interactivity and validation
- Generating CSS for responsive and accessible design
- Integrating external APIs for dynamic content
- Optimizing code for performance and maintainability

## My Workflow

I used the AI assistant to brainstorm solutions, generate code snippets, and review my work. I often asked for advice on best practices and ways to improve user experience. The AI provided helpful suggestions, which I reviewed and adapted to fit my project’s needs.

## Edits and Customization

All AI-generated code was carefully reviewed and modified to match my project’s structure and style. I made sure to test everything and adjust logic, variable names, and UI as needed. I also removed any unnecessary code and ensured accessibility and performance were prioritized.

## What I Learned

- How to use AI as a coding partner for faster development
- The importance of reviewing and customizing AI-generated code
- New techniques for state management, validation, and UI/UX
- How to optimize a web app for speed and efficiency
